## About Codewars

[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) is a community-driven platform that offers coding challenges, also known as "katas," where developers can practice and improve their coding skills across multiple programming languages. Codewars allows you to solve challenges in various difficulty levels, from beginner to expert, while honing your problem-solving abilities and collaborating with other developers around the world.

## Repository Contents

In this repository, you will find a collection of Ruby solutions to the Codewars katas. The solutions are organized into directories based on their respective difficulty levels. Each solution comes with a detailed explanation of the problem and the approach taken to solve it. You can explore the different directories to find challenges that match your skill level or areas you want to improve in Ruby programming.

## Disclaimer

Please note that Codewars encourages users not to copy solutions directly from the platform for the sake of learning and personal growth. While this repository contains solutions, it is essential to attempt the challenges on Codewars first before referring to any external solutions.

## Acknowledgments

A big thanks to all the contributors who have worked on the katas in this repository and helped improve the Ruby coding skills of others.
